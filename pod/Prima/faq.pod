=head1 NAME

Prima::faq - Frequently asked questions about Prima

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The FAQ covers various topics around Prima, such as distribution, compilation,
installation, and programming.

=head1 COMMON

=head2 What is Prima?

Prima is a general purpose extensible graphical user interface toolkit with a
rich set of standard widgets and an emphasis on 2D image processing tasks. A
Perl program using PRIMA looks and behaves identically on X, Win32 and OS/2 PM.

=head2 Yeah, right. So what is Prima again?

Ok. A Yet Another Perl GUI.

=head2 Why bother with the Yet Another thing, while there is Perl-Tk and plenty of others?

Prima was started on OS/2, where Tk didn't really run. We have had two options
- either port Tk, or write something on our own, probably better than the
existing tools.  We believe that we've succeeded.

=head2 Why Perl?

Why not? Perl is great. The high-level GUI logic fits badly into C, C++, or the
like, so a scripting language is probably the way to go here.

=head2 But I want to use Prima in another language.

Unless your language has runtime binding with perl, you cannot.

=head2 Who wrote Prima?

Dmitry Karasik implemented the majority of the toolkit, after the original idea
by Anton Berezin. The latter and set of contributors helped the development of
the toolkit since then.

=head2 What is the copyright?

The copyright is a modified BSD license, where only two first paragraphs remain
out of the original four. The text of copyright is present is almost all files
of the toolkit.

=head2 I'd like to contribute.

You can do this is several ways. The project would probably best benefit from
the advocacy, because not many people use it. Of course, you can send it new
widgets, patches, suggestions, or even donations. Also, documentation is the
thing that needs a particular attention, since my native language is not
English, so if there are volunteers for polishing the of Prima does, you are
very welcome.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Where can I download Prima? 

L<http://www.prima.eu.org> contains links to source and binary download
resources, instructions on how to subscribe to the Prima mailing list,
documentation, and some other useful info.

=head2 What is better, source or binary?

Depends where your are and what are your goal. On unix, the best is to use the
source. On win32 and os2 the binaries probably are preferred. If you happen to
use cygwin you probably still better off using the source.

=head2 How to install binary distribution?

First, check if you've downloaded Prima binary for the correct version of Perl.
For win32 ActiveState builds, difference in the minor digits of the Perl
version shouldn't be a problem, for example, binary distribution for Perl build
#805 should work with Perl build #808, etc etc.

To install, unpack the archive and type 'perl ms_install.pl'.  The files will
be copied into the perl tree.

=head2 How to compile from source?

Type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make 
   make install

If the 'perl Makefile.PL' fails complaining to strange errors, you can check
makefile.log to see whether anything is wrong. A typical situation here is that
Makefile.PL may report that is cannot find Perl library, for example, where
there actually it invokes the compiler in a wrong way.

Note, that in order to get Prima working from sources, your system must contain
graphic libraries, such as libungif or ligjpeg, for Prima to load graphic
files.

=head2 What's about the graphic libraries?

To load and save images, Prima employs graphic libraries. Such as, to load GIF
files, libungif library is used, etc. Makefile.PL finds available libraries and
links Prima against these. It is possible to compile Prima without any, but this
is not really useful. If Makefile.PL wouldn't find any of the supported graphic
libraries, it would abort unless WANTNOCODECS=1 parameter was supplied to it.

On every supported platform Prima can make use of the following graphic
libraries:

   libX11   - XBM bitmaps
   libXpm   - Xpm pixmaps
   libjpeg  - JPEG images
   libungif - GIF images
   libpng   - PNG images
   libtiff  - tiff images

Alternatively, on win32 and os2 there is a binary PRIGPARH library distributed
together with the Prima binary distributions, which supports its own set of
graphic files. The PRIGPARH is a modified GBM graphic library, which ( GBM ) is
no longer supported, but nevertheless it is useful for Prima. The use of
PRIGPARH is preferred on win32 and os2, and Makefile.PL would favor it before
the other graphic libraries.  To compile and run Prima with PRIGPARH, library (
.lib or .a) and runtime ( .dll ) files must be present in the LIBPATH and PATH,
correspondingly.

=head2 img/codec_XXX.c compile error

C<img/codec_XXX.c> files are C sources for support of the graphic libraries. In
case a particular codec does not compile, the ultimate fix is to remove the
file and re-run Makefile.PL . This way, the problem can be avoided easily,
although at cost of a lacking support for a graphic format.

=head2 Compile error

There are various reasons why a compilation reason may fail. The best would be
to copy the output together with outputs of env and perl -V and send these into
the Prima mailing list.

=head2 Prima doesn't run

Again, there are reasons for Prima to fail during the start.

First, check whether all main files are installed correctly. F<Prima.pm> must
be in your perl folder, and Prima library file ( F<Prima.a> or F<Prima.so> for
unix, F<Prima.dll> for win32, and F<PrimaDI.dll> for os2 ) is copied in the
correct location in the perl tree. 

Second, try to run 'perl -MPrima -e 1' . If Prima.pm is not found, the error
message would something like 

  Can't locate Prima.pm in @INC

If Prima library or one of the libraries it depends on cannot be found, perl
Dynaloader would complain. On win32 and os2 this usually happen when
prigraph.dll ( and/or priz.dll on os2 ) are not found. If this is the case, try
to copy these files into your PATH, for example in C:/WINNT .

=head2 Prima error: Can't open display

This error happens when you've compiled Prima for X11, and no connection to X11
display can be established. Check your DISPLAY environment variable, or use
--display parameter when running Prima. If you do not want Prima to connect to
the display, for example, to use it inside a CGI script, either use --no-x11
parameter or include C<use Prima::noX11> statement in your program.

=head2 X11: my fonts are bad!

Check whether you've Xft and fontconfig installed. Prima benefits greatly from
having been compiled with Xft/fontconfig. Read more in L<Prima::X11> .

=head2 Where are the docs installed?

Prima documentation comes in .pm and .pod files. These, when installed,
are copied under perl tree, and under man tree in unix. So, 
'perldoc Prima' should be a sufficient command to invoke the main page
of the Prima documentation. Other pages can be invoked as 'perldoc Prima::Buttons',
say, or, for the graphical pod reader, 'podview Prima::Buttons'. podview
is the Prima doc viewer, which is also capable of displaying any POD page.

There are also a pdf file on the Prima web site www.prima.eu.org, which contains
the same set of documentation but composed as a single book. Its sources are
in utils/makedoc directory, somewhat rudimentary and require an installation
of latex and dvips to produce one of tex, dvi, ps, or pdf targets.

=head2 I've found a bug!

Send the bug report into the mailing list.

=head1 PROGRAMMING

=head2 How can I use .fm files of the Visual Builder inside my program?

podview L<Prima::VB::VBLoader>

=head2 I want to use Prima inside CGI for loading and converting images only, without X11 display.

   use Prima::noX11; # this prevents Prima from connecting to X11 display
   use Prima;
   my $i = Prima::Image-> load( ... )

=head2 How would I change several properties with a single call?

   $widget-> set(
      property1 => $value1,
      property2 => $value2,
      ...
   );

=head2 I want Prima::Edit to have feature XXX

If the feature is not governed by none of the C<Prima::Edit> properties,
you've to overload C<::on_paint>. It is not that hard as you might think.

If the feature is generic enough, you can send a patch in the list.

=head2 Tk ( Wx, Qt, whatever ) has a feature Prima doesn't.

Well, I'd probably love to see the feature in Prima as well, but I don't
have a time to write it myself. Send in a patch, and I promise I'll check it out.

=head2 I wrote a program and it looks ugly with another font size

This would most certainly happen when you rely on your own screen properties.
There are several ways to avoid this problem. 

First, if you program a window where there are many widgets independent of each
other size, you actually can supply coordinates for these widget as they are 
positioned on your screen. The only thing not to forget is to set C<designScale>
property of the parent window, which is dimension of font used to design the
window. You can get these for example by executing

    perl -MPrima -MPrima::Application -le '$_=$::application->font; print $_->width, q( ), $_->height';

This way, the window and widget would get resized automatically under another font.

Second, in case your widget layout is not that independent, you can position the
widgets relatively to each other by explicitly calculating widget extension. For
example, an C<InputLine> would have height relative to the font, and to have a
widget placed exactly say 2 pixels above the input line, code something like

    my $input = $owner-> insert( InputLine, ... );
    my $widget = $owner-> insert( Widget, bottom => $input-> top + 2 );

Of course you can change the font yourself, but it is a bad idea since users
would get annoyed by this. 

Finally, check your layouts with L<Prima::Stress> written specifically for this
purpose:

    perl -MPrima::Stress myprogram

=head2 How would I write a widget class myself?

There are lots and lots of examples of this. Find a widget class similar to
what you are about to write, and follow the idea. There are, though, some inevident
moments worth to enumerate.

=over

=item *

Test your widget class with different default settings, such as colors, fonts,
parent sizes, widget properties such as buffered and visible.

=item *

Try to avoid special properties for C<create>, where for example a particular property
must always be supplied, or not supplied, or a particular combination of properties is
expected. See if the DWIM principle can be applied instead.

=item *

Do not be afraid to define and re-define notification types. These have large number
of options, to be programmed once and then used as a DWIM helper. Consider for which
notifications user callback routines ( onXxxx ) would be best to be called first, or
last, whether a notification should be of multiple or single callback type.

If there is a functionality better off performed by the user-level code, consider
creating an individual notification for this purpose.

=item *

Repaint only the changed areas, not the whole widget.

If your widget has scrollable areas, use C<scroll> method. 

Inside C<on_paint> check whether the whole or only a part of the widget is
about to be repainted. Simple optimizations here increase the speed.

Avoid using pre-cooked data in C<on_paint>, such as when for example only a
particular part of a widget was invalidated, and this fact is stored in an
internal variable. This is because when the actual C<on_paint> call is
executed, the invalid area may be larger than was invalidated by the class
actions. 

If you must though, compare values of C<clipRect> property to see
whether the invalid area is indeed the same as it is expected. 

Remember, that inside on_paint all coordinates are inclusive-inclusive, 
and outside inclusive-exclusive.

Note, that C<buffered> property does not guarantee that the widget
output would be actually buffered.

=item *

Write some documentation and example of use.

=back

=head2 How would I add my widget class to the VB palette?

Check Prima/VB/examples/Widgety.pm . This file, if loaded through
'Add widget' command in VB, adds example widget class and example 
VB property into the VB palette and Object Inspector.
