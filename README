PRIMA is a general purpose extensible graphical user interface 
toolkit with a rich set of standard widgets and an emphasis on 
2D image processing tasks. A Perl program using PRIMA looks 
and behaves identically on X, Win32 and OS/2 PM. 

INSTALLATION
============

Create a makefile by running Makefile.PL using the perl
program into whose library you want to install and then run
make ( or nmake for Win32 and OS/2) three times:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If perl Makefile.PL fails, compilation commands along with errors 
can be found in makefile.log. 

If some of the required libraries or include files can not
be found, INCPATH+=/some/include and LIBPATH+=/some/lib semantics
should be used to tell Makefile.PL about these.

To install into a private library, for example your home
directory:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/lib/perl

If make fails with message

** No image codecs found

that means you don't have image libraries that Prima supports in your path.
Prima supports libungif, libjpeg and gbm compiled customly
and named libprigraph. For win32 users it is recommended to
download http://www.prima.eu.org/download/prigraph.lib and
http://www.prima.eu.org/download/prima_dlls.zip. prigraph.lib should be
put into LIBPATH, and prima_dll.zip is to be unpacked and primguts.dll
and zlib.dll to be put in the same directory to Prima.dll ( which appears 
after successful compilation in auto/Prima subdirectory ).

BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION
================================

Copy all files to the perl distribution with the hierarchy 
structure preserved. You have to patch Prima::Config.pm 
manually if you need to compile prima-dependent modules.


EXAMPLES
========

Look at the code located in examples subdirectory.
Typical code starts with

   use Prima qw(Application);

and ends with
   
   run Prima;

which is an event loop call. Try to begin from the followind code:

   use Prima qw(Application Buttons);

   Prima::Window-> create(
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      size     => [ 200, 200],
   )-> insert( Button =>
      centered => 1,
      text     => 'Hello world!',
      onClick  => sub { $::application-> close },
   );

   run Prima;
